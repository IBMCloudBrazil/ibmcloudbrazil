### Getting Started in Developing Microservices with Open Liberty and MicroProfile

When building new cloud ready applications, the current trend is to leverage the microservices architecture to create small, loosely coupled services instead of giant monoliths. In order to get up and running quickly, you'll need the right guides, tools, and runtime. In this webinar we'll demonstrate how to build microservices using Open Liberty, the open source foundation of IBM WebSphere Liberty, as your Java runtime.  We'll use Open Liberty's implementation of MicroProfile, the optimized Enterprise Java microservices architecture, and openliberty.io's (https://openliberty.io/) easy to follow guides to ensure rapid development and application portability.
